# Currency Converter

This project is a simple Currency Converter application developed using Java Applets. It allows users to convert values between different currencies using a graphical interface.

The project demonstrates two versions of the same application logic, one being more efficient than other.

Both approaches provide a good comparison between conditional structures in Java, especially for beginners and learners.



## ðŸš€ Features
Intuitive Applet-based GUI for currency conversion.

Converts currencies like INR, USD, EUR, GBP, etc.

Clean code separation: two files with different logic handling.

Good for learning Java Applet programming and basic control structures.

# ðŸ§  What You'll Learn
How to build GUIs using Java Applets.

About different components of Java Applet.

Implementing logical conditions using if-else and switch-case.

Handling user input through text fields and dropdowns.

# ðŸ”§ Requirements
JDK (Java Development Kit) version 8 or below

Applet viewer (included in JDK 8)

# ðŸ“Œ How to Run
Make sure you have JDK installed.

Compile the Java files:

*javac filename.java*

Run the applet using the applet viewer:

*appletviewer filename.java* OR *java filename*

Note: Applet support has be deprecated in newer versions of Java. Use Java 8 or earlier with applet viewer for best results.
